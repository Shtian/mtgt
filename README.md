# Magic the Gathering: Tournament

This project is created mainly in order to play around with angularjs and firebase.
My goal is to have a way to create an all-play-all tournament overview for drafting sessions.
Each player should be able to log in and create a tournament with other users.
Each round should be randomized and winners (best out of 3) from each match recorded.

The project is forked from an AngularFire seed.
